🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Vamsi, a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in web development.
I enjoy building clean, responsive, and dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m currently expanding my skills in React.

I have hands-on experience developing real-world projects such as:

Dynamic E-Commerce websites using APIs

JavaScript DOM manipulation projects

Interactive browser-based games

Currently, I’m working on my final-year project:
“Cyber Threat Detection using Reinforcement Learning”
and actively preparing for front-end / full-stack internship opportunities.
